# TODO

- [ ] Add `clean` command to remove all completed tasks. The intention would be to centralize how *done tasks* are handled to avoid having to read the tasks file in order to find the next `id` by removing the necessity to manually clean the file. The current implementation for searching the next ID is to just read the last record.
- [ ] Add `password` command (with things like `add` or `use`) to manage passwords. For now it's just an idea, it probably won't replace any existing password managers.
- [ ] Add `export` command to export tasks to a file in a specific format (JSON or CSV).
- [ ] Add `import` command to import tasks from a file in a specific format (JSON or CSV).
- [ ] Maybe add `tags`
